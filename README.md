# BLHELI_32_to_RTTTL
### This program takes a BLHELI_32 music string and converts it to RTTTL for BlueJay ESC firmware

## Execution:
If you don't know how to execute a python script I reccomend using an online-tool to execute the simple script.
Just google "Python Interpreter Online" (like https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/)

Copy the contents of the file **main.py** into the online-editor and press run (or similar).

Once the script starts a commandline interface opens which I hope it is self-explainatory.
I am happy to receive feedback.

## Input:
I hope I got all syntax of BLHELI_32 music covered (if not, contact me on BlueJay Discord). Just copy-paste your music (without "quotations") into the prompt when asked.
The formatting is explained in the UI.

#### Note

I know this isn't the prettiest code. Feel free to improve ;)

### Have fun using your BLHELI_32 songs again :)
