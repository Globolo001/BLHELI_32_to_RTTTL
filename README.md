# BLHELI_32_to_RTTTL
### This program takes a BLHELI_32 music string and converts it to RTTTL for Blue Jay ESC ###

## Execution:
If you don't know how to execute a python script I would reccomend using an online-tool to execute the simple script.
Just google "Python Interpreter Online" (like https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/)

Copy the contents of the file **main.py** into the editor and press run (or similar).

Once the script starts a commandline interface opens which I hope it is self-explainatory.
I am happy to receive feedback.

## Input:
I hope I got all syntax of BLHELI_32 music covered (if not, contact me on BlueJay Discord). Just copy-paste it into the prompt when asked.
Melody fomatting is: "**A#5 8 P8 A#5 8**" OR "**A#58 P8 A#58**" OR mixed.
With the default 2 parameters, those inputs will lead to
"test1:b=210,o=3,d=4:**8a#5,8p,8a#5**"

#### Note

I know this isn't the pretties code. Feel free to improve ;)

### Have fun using your BLHELI_32 songs again :)
